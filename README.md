The goal of `ltertools` is to centralize the R functions created by
members of the long term ecological research (LTER) community. Many of
these functions likely have broad relevance that expands beyond the
context of their creation and this package is an attempt to share those
tools to save us all from “re-inventing the wheel.”

## Installation

You can install the development version of `ltertools` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")

```
