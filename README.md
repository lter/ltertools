The goal of `ltertools` is to centralize the R functions created by
members of the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) community. Many of
these functions likely have broad relevance that expands beyond the
context of their creation and this package is an attempt to share those
tools to limit the amount of “re-inventing the wheel” that we each do in
our own silos.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `ltertools` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lter/ltertools")
```
