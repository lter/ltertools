## Overview

The `ltertools` package 

The goal of `ltertools` is to centralize the R functions created by members of the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) community. Many of these functions likely have broad relevance that expands beyond the context of their creation and this package is an attempt to share those tools and limit the amount of "re-inventing the wheel" that we each do in our own silos.

The conceptual theme of functions in `ltertools` is necessarily broad given the scope of the community we aim to serve. That said, the identity of this package will likely become more clear as we accrue contributed functions. This vignette describes the main functions of `ltertools` as they currently exist.

```{r setup}
# devtools::install_github("lter/ltertools")
library(ltertools)
```

### Harmonization

The LTER Network is hypothesis-driven with a focus on long term data from sites in the network. This results in data that may reasonably be compared but are--potentially--quite differently formatted based on the logic of the investigators responsible for each dataset. Data harmonization (the process of resolving these formatting inconsistencies to facilitate combination/comparison across projects) is therefore a significant hurdle for many projects using LTER data. We suggest a "column key"-based approach that has the potential to _greatly_ simplify harmonization efforts.

This method requires researchers to develop a 3-column key that contains (1) the name of each raw data file to be harmonized, (2) the name of all of the columns in each of those files, and (3) the "tidy name" that corresponds to each raw column name. Each dataset can then be read in and have its raw names replaced with the tidy ones specified in the key. Once this has been done to all files in the specified folder, they can be combined by their newly consistent column names.

`harmonize`


A visual version of this column key approach to harmonization is included for convenience here:

One is pulled out and its column names are replaced based on their respective 'tidy names' in the column key table. This is done for each of the other tables then the four tables--with fixed column names--are combined into a single data table" width="100%">

### LTER Information

The LTER Network is composed of many separate sites. While all of these sites are "long term" they do vary slightly in when they were created. For those interested in knowing the temporal coverage of data from a particular site or group of sites, `site_timeline` can prove a helpful function. This function creates a `ggplot2` timeline where sites are on the vertical axis and years are on the horizontal. Lines are colored based on the habitat of the site and there is support for a user-defined set of hexadecimal colors though by default an internal palette is used.

Sites can be specified by their three letter site code or all sites in a particular habitat can be included.
```{r site-timeline-1, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 7}
# Check the timeline for all grassland or forest LTER sites
ltertools::site_timeline(habitats = c("grassland", "forest"))
```

Running the function without specifying site codes or habitat types will result in a timeline of all active LTER sites.
```{r site-timeline-2, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}
# Check the timeline for all LTER sites
ltertools::site_timeline()
```
