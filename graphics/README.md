# `ltertools` Graphic Development

This folder contains the source files for any/all graphics needed by the `ltertools` package. To minimize the risk of losing access in the future graphic development is done in a Microsoft PowerPoint file where images can be edited then 'Save as Image'd to their proper places in the package build. Note this folder _is_ tracked by Git but **_is not_** included in the package build.
